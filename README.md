# FAT16-file-parser

The goal of the project was to build a parser of file containers, stored in FAT16 format.
To complete the project, I prepared a set of API functions to implement the following functionality:


✔ Opening, reading and closing a block device (in the form of a file).  
✔ Opening and closing a volume in 16 format.  
✔ Opening, searching, reading and closing FAT files.  
✔ Opening, reading and closing directories.  

The project was uploaded and checked with unit tests on this [site](https://dante.iis.p.lodz.pl/).
